                    <p class="mb-0 pl-3">It is possible that Spotify playlist curators for whom we provide contact information will request from our users a fee in exchange for getting added to their playlists. As stated by Spotify’s guidelines, no playlist curator is allowed to receive compensation in exchange for including a musician’s song on their playlists. If this policy is violated, consequences may occur, such as temporary or permanent removal from the Spotify platform. It is therefore fundamental to state in our terms and agreements that PlaylistMap only provides contact data and email templates for pitching music, and we are not liable for any subsequent correspondence between playlist curators and PlaylistMap users. In the event that you are removed from Spotify or otherwise penalized for providing payment to a playlist curator in exchange for inclusion, you hereby agree that you will not hold PlaylistMap responsible for any repercussions imposed by Spotify. It is possible that playlist curators stop updating playlists over time, replace songs previously included in playlists, or delete entire playlists. Any of these situations can lead to the removal of your song from a given playlist. As such, PlaylistMap is not liable for any changes or removals that happen to your music. PlaylistMap is a supplier of contact data, and whether a client receives an email response from a curator and/or gets accepted to a playlist is not under our control or influence. PlaylistMap’s solitary service is to provide contact data and communication support by means of email templates. PlaylistMap has no lawful risk for any negative experience that happens as a result of utilizing our features. By registering to our services, Users are additionally consenting to receive email messages and other advertising content. Users consent to receive promotional content showcasing features, updates, and other information from Playlistmap. Users have the right to unregister from our email list at any time. Users are not permitted to utilize PlaylistMap’s contact database improperly, for example, by scraping the information or spamming/attacking the curators. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time. You understand that your content (not including credit card information), may be transferred unencrypted and involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.
