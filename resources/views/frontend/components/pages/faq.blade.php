                <div class="text secondary-color mt-3">We automatically update our catalog daily. Every time we update it, we add more and more playlists and make sure the information for our current ones are up-to-date. With more than 20,000 playlists already on our catalog, PlaylistMap has more curator contacts than any of our competitors.</div>

                <div class="text secondary-color mt-3">A credit is the currency you use to unlock a Spotify playlist curator’s contact information on our platform. One credit gets you one unlock. Each of our plans offers a different amount of credits. With more credits, you’ll have more opportunities to get in touch with relevant curators, introduce them to your music, and get added to their playlists.</div>

                <div class="text secondary-color mt-3">If you don’t use all of your credits, then you’re not pitching enough! For the best results, use all of the credits you pay for — this will increase your chances of getting included on your ideal playlists. At the end of each month, any remaining credits will roll over to the next month. If you decide to cancel your subscription, you can use your remaining credits until the end of the last paid month.</div>

                <div class="text secondary-color mt-3">We do our best to verify every Spotify playlist curator’s contact information, but in the event that it’s wrong, let us know by clicking the “report” button on the “My Unlocks” section on your profile, and we will check it out. If the contact information is fake or incorrect, we will refund your credit.</div>

                <div class="text secondary-color mt-3">Never pay a curator in exchange for getting added to their playlist. We know it’s tempting, but trust us, don’t do it. If you do, you’ll be in violation of <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/end-user-agreement/#9-user-guidelines" target="_blank">Spotify’s policies</a> , which could lead you to getting kicked off their platform. Or, the playlist might get taken down. Technically, Spotify playlist curators are allowed to accept payments for listening to songs, as long as they don’t “sell” spots on their playlists.</div>
